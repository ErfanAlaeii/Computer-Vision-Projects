IC Component Detection Using OpenCV
This project involves the detection of IC components on a motherboard using the OpenCV library. The objective of this project was to accurately and quickly identify various electronic components on the motherboard. Initially, my employer provided a code that had several issues and bugs and was unable to correctly detect the components.

Limitations and Challenges:

I was restricted to using OpenCV and could not employ advanced deep learning tools.
The main challenge was achieving high accuracy in identifying different components using classical computer vision methods, which typically have lower accuracy compared to advanced deep learning models.
Solution:

After numerous efforts and optimizations, I was able to revise the code and significantly improve the accuracy of component detection.
Call for Collaboration:
I invite the developer community to contribute to improving this code. If you have any suggestions or ideas to enhance the performance of the code, please contact me via email.

Thank you for your attention, and I hope we can achieve even better results together!
